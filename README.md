This is a simple comparison between Polars and Pandas as used in a Plotly Dash App. 

## Introduction
This app includes 3 main pages:
1. **Speed Comparison**: An interactive speed comparison between Polars and Pandas. This is not fully optimized or a true benchmark, but it gives a rough idea of the speed difference between the two libraries.
2. **Polars Dash Recipes**: A collection of recipes for using Polars in Dash. The main idea is to explore syntax differences that might be helpful for someone transitioning from Pandas to Polars.
3. **Minimal Dash App** (in Polars): This example is from the [Dash documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks), rewritten with Polars instead of Pandas.
